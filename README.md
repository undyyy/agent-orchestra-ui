# Agent Orchestra UI (Mock)

A lightweight, static mockup for managing multiple agents at once.

## Goals
- High-level visibility across many agents
- Event stream for quick situational awareness
- Clear control affordances (pause/resume/retry)

## Run locally
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8091 --directory .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8091`.

## Status
This is a UI mock only (no backend orchestration yet).
